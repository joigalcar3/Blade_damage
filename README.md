# Blade_damage
Python code use for the identification of the lift and drag coefficient polynomials of the drone blades, as well as 
the computation of the forces and moments generated by the (damaged) propeller with BEM theory.

The project contains the following files:
* *Propeller.py*: Propeller holds all the information related to the propeller assembly as a whole and contains a list with all the
Blade objects that define the Propeller. It is used for calling methods applicable to all the blades which are required
for the computation of the Propeller center of gravity, as well as the moments and forces generated by the Propeller. 
Additionally, it updates the rotation state of the propeller; carries out the identification of the lift and drag
coefficient polynomials by equating the thrust and torque computed with BEM and the Matlab model identified in the
wind tunnel (using an average rotation or a single time instance); computes the uniform inflow field.

* *Blade.py*: Blade holds all the information related to a single blade and contains a list with all the BladeSection objects that
define the Blade. It is used for calling methods applicable to all the BladeSections which are required for the
computation of the Blade center of gravity, blade area and mass, as well as the moments and forces generated by the
Blade. Additionally, it computes the contribution for the identification of the lift and drag coefficient relative to a
single blade.

* *BladeSection.py*: Provides the BladeSection, class for the aerodynamic model identification and computation of forces and moments.
BladeSection holds all the information related to a single blade element according to BEM theory. It is used for the
computation of the angle of attack and velocity seen by each BladeSection. Additionally, it computes the contribution
of the BladeSection lift and drag to the thrust force and torque.

* *helper_func.py*: Provides the helper functions, workhorse of the whole blade damage implementation
It contains functions that carry out simple mathematical/geometrical computations, implements the aerodynamic matlab
model, implements the model identification and all the plotters.

* *helper_func_unittest.py* (WIP): Provides the helper functions unittests. It contains the unittests for checking the correct work of the helper functions

* *aero_data.py*: Provides aerodynamic data of the Bebop2 identified in the wind tunnel at TUDelft. It contains the aerodynamic parameters for the Matlab model computations

* *main.py*: Provides the code for testing the main capabilities of the Blade damage project. Basic code to compute the generated moments and forces due to propeller damage


## Assumptions (WIP)
Next are listed the assumptions taken for the drag and lift coefficient coefficients polynomial curve
identification and the computation of the moments and forces of the propeller.

Assumptions:
- Homogeneous mass along the blade: the centroid equals the location of the cg.
- The blade is cut parallel to the edge of the propeller such that the remaining polygon is still a trapezoid.
- The Bebop 2 blades are simplified as two trapezoids with parallel sides connected by the long parallel side.
- The induced velocity is computed with the simplified linear induced inflow.
- The nonlinear effects between (damaged) blades are not considered.

## Main results (WIP)
Here are the main results from this project. They are divided between those results corresponding to the 
identification of the lift and drag coefficients polynomials and the vibrations caused by the modified location
of the center of gravity and aerodynamics upon blade damage.

### Lift and drag coefficients Bebop 2 identification

Next are the identified lift and drag curves. Using the default parameters in *user_input.py*, the lift coefficient
polynomial has the following form:

In the case of the drag coefficient polynomial, it has the following form:
